# Core Concepts

**1. Ordered**

Elements in an array have a definite order.

**2. One Dimensional**

The items are arranged in a one-dimensional sequence

**3. Indexed**

Elements in an array are indexed using zero-based indexing. This means that the first element in an array has the `index` of `0`, while the last element has an `index` of `array.length - 1`

**4. Fixed Size**

Arrays are stored in one contiguous block of memory. This means that elements are kept right next to each other in memory, in terms of their memory addresses. Finding an element of an array is possible by knowing (ahead of time) the size of each element and the address of any element in the array. 

For example, if we know that:

1. The size of each element in an array is `4 bytes`
2. The memory address of where the array is stored
3. We want the 6th element in the array

We can infer `array[6] = (4 bytes * 6 index) + (Memory Address of array[0])`. This will make more sense when we explore the hexadecimal math behind this pseudo-equation. 

**5. Mutability**

Individual elements of an array can be _mutated_ (in other words, _changed_). However, the size of an array cannot. This is due to the fixed size concept: when you add new elements to an array, your computer is actually finding a new block of memory that has enough space to store the updated contents of the array. 

**6. Homogeneous **

An array holds only one kind of (reference or value) type that is defined when the array is created. 


# Mutability and Fixed Sizes in Practice (Swift)

We are going to explore the interaction between fixed sizes, indexing, and mutability using Swift

Given an array of String

```swift
var stringArray: [String] = ["this", "is", "a", "test"]
```

We are able to locate where in memory the array is stored, using `withUnsafePointer`

```swift
// the & is used in special circumstances to get the data at a specific place in memory
withUnsafePointer(to: &stringArray) { p in

  print("Element: \(stringArray),   Address: \(p))")
  // prints: Element: ["this", "is", "a", "test"],   Address: 0x000000010fc75c10)
  
  print(p.pointee)
  // prints: ["this", "is", "a", "test"]
}
```

We can also find the size (in `bytes`) of an element of an array

```swift
let sizeOfString = MemoryLayout.size(ofValue: stringArray[0]) // size in bytes
print(sizeOfString)
// prints: 24 
```

![Allocating Memory for An Array and Its Contents](./Images/allocatingArray.png)

The memory address for the reference to the array struct can differ from the contiguous memory allocated for the contents of the array:

```swift
withUnsafePointer(to: &stringArray[0]) { p in

  print("Element: \(stringArray[0]),   Address: \(p)")
  //prints: Element: this,   Address: 0x00006100000e1820)
}
```

But what is for certain, is that there will be contiguous 24 byte blocks from the first element of that array. 

![Contiguous Address Space](./Images/addressSpaceAndSteps.png)

And we can verify this in two ways.

*With Code*

```swift
withUnsafePointer(to: &stringArray[0]) { p in
  
  // p in this closure is of type UnsafePointer and refers to the memory address of the object passed to the function
  print(p)                 // prints: 0x00006100000e1820
  
  // the advance(by:) function allows you to move forward in a sequence by n places
  print(p.advanced(by: 1)) // prints: 0x00006100000e1838
  print(p.advanced(by: 2)) // prints: 0x00006100000e1850
  print(p.advanced(by: 3)) // prints: 0x00006100000e1868

  // the .pointee propery of UnsafePointer returns the value at a memory address
  print(p.pointee)                 // prints: "this"
  print(p.advanced(by: 1).pointee) // prints: "is"
  print(p.advanced(by: 2).pointee) // prints: "a"
  print(p.advanced(by: 3).pointee) // prints: "test"
}
```

*With Hex Math*

| index | element |address | significant | difference (10) | distance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | "this"  | 0x00006100000e1820 | 0x20 | (16^1) * 2) + (16^0 * 0) = 32   | - |
| 1 | "is"    | 0x00006100000e1838 | 0x38 | (16^1) * 3) + (16^0 * 8) = 56   | 24 bytes |
| 2 | "a"     | 0x00006100000e1850 | 0x50 | (16^1) * 5) + (16^0 * 0) = 80   | 24 bytes |
| 3 | "test"  | 0x00006100000e1868 | 0x68 | (16^1) * 6) + (16^0 * 8) = 104  | 24 bytes |

![Hex Math Applied](./Images/calculatedAddresses.png)

Though, because the array has a fixed size, inserting an element is going to result in the array being recreated elsewhere in memory with enough contiguous space for the additional element. 

```swift
stringArray.insert("NEW STRING", at: 0)
withUnsafePointer(to: &stringArray[0]) { p in
  print(p)                  // 0x00006100001b53a0
  print(p.advanced(by: 1))  // 0x00006100001b53b8
  print(p.advanced(by: 2))  // 0x00006100001b53d0
  print(p.advanced(by: 3))  // 0x00006100001b53e8
  print(p.advanced(by: 4))  // 0x00006100001b5400
  
  print(p.pointee)                  // "NEW STRING"
  print(p.advanced(by: 1).pointee)  // "this"
  print(p.advanced(by: 2).pointee)  // "is"
  print(p.advanced(by: 3).pointee)  // "a"
  print(p.advanced(by: 4).pointee)  // "test"
}
```

We can further verify these addresses with some more hex math

| index | element |address | significant | difference (10) | distance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | "NEW STRING"  | 0x00006100001b53a0 | 0x3a0 | (16^2 * 3) + (16^1 * 10) + (16^0 * 0) = 928 | - |
| 1 | "this"        | 0x00006100001b53b8 | 0x3b8 | (16^2 * 3) + (16^1 * 11) + (16^0 * 8) = 952 | 24 bytes |
| 2 | "is"          | 0x00006100001b53d0 | 0x3d0 | (16^2 * 3) + (16^1 * 13) + (16^0 * 0) = 976 | 24 bytes |
| 3 | "a"           | 0x00006100001b53e8 | 0x3e8 | (16^2 * 3) + (16^1 * 14) + (16^0 * 8) = 1000| 24 bytes |
| 4 | "test"        | 0x00006100001b5400 | 0x400 | (16^2 * 4) + (16^1 *  0) + (16^0 * 8) = 1024| 24 bytes |


What remains unchanged, however, is the address of the reference to the array. The reference itself will be updated to have the new location of the first element in the updated array, however.

```swift
stringArray.insert("NEW STRING", at: 0)
withUnsafePointer(to: &stringArray) { p in
  
  print(p)
  // prints: 0x000000010fc75c10
  // this is the same as before (check it out)
}
```

Lastly, we can change the value of an element at a given index without changing the address

```swift
stringArray[4] = "TEST STRING"
withUnsafePointer(to: &stringArray[4]) { p in
  print(p)                  // 0x00006100001b5400
  print(p.pointee)          // "TEST STRING"
}
```

# Performance 

An array is stored as a contiguous block of memory, which determines its performance for specific actions:

1. Accessing an Element: O(1)
  - Since we know know where the block of memory is and the size of the array is fixed, getting the element at an index is a matter of multiplying the size of the type of the element by the index, and adding that to the memory address of the array (as demonstrated with our hex math above). Computers can do this kind of look up very quickly as it involves just a single, simple calculation. 
2. Inserting an Element at beginning: O(n)
  - This requires shifting all other elements, hence O(n)
3. Inserting an Element at end
  - If array is full: O(n) : array needs to be copied in its entirety to a new block of memory
  - If array is not full: O(1) : if there's still room allocated (let's say there's one more 24 byte block free for an array), then we can mutate the contents of memory at that byte block's address without having to copy the array into another (more spacious) location. 
  

# Multi-Dimensional Arrays
An array on its own as a data structure, is one dimensional. However, arrays can contain any reference or value type.. like other arrays. An array who's elements are arrays, are called multi-dimensional arrays. 

**Common Multi-Dimensional Arrays**

1. Two-Dimensional
  1. Game boards (Chess, Checkers, Bingo, Sudoku, etc.) 
  2. Maps (Coordinate systems using Lat. & Long.)
  3. Images (Describing the x- and y-position of a point in the image)
  4. Spreadsheets (Uses row/col system)
5. Three-Dimensional
  6. 3D Animations and Games (a single point in 3D space has an x-, y-, and z-position)
  7. Virtual Reality
8. Multi-Dimensional
  9. Mostly advanced mathematics and physics

# Quick Exercises

**Two Dimensional Array Iterrations**

Iterate through a two dimensional array of integers And print out all the elements starting with the first row and ending with the last row.:

```swift 
let inputArray: [[Int]] = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
  [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
  [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
]

// output should look like: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20"
```

How would the code be different if:

1. You started with the first column and ended with the last column?
2. You excluded the first row and excluded the last column?
3. You print only the diagonal? How about exclude the diagonal?
4. You print only the items on the border?

**Sudoku**

Rules: The is a 9x9 gird where the objective is to place the numbers 1 to 9 in the empty squares so that each _row_, each _column_ and each _3x3 box_ contains the same number only once.

![Sudoku Example](./Images/sudokuExamples.png)

Exercise: Write a function that will check whether or not a fully filled sudoku board is a valid solution. 
  - Input: 2D Array of Ints ranging from 1-9 
  - Output: True or false

```swift  
func checkSudokuBoard(sudokuBoard:[[Int]]) -> Bool {
  return true
}
```
