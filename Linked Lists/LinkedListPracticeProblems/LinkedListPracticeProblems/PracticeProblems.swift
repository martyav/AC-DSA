import Foundation

//Review One: Write a Node class and a Singly Linked List class that has a variable Node() at the head

//Review Two: Write a print printAllKeys() method in your linked list class


//Review Three: Write an append(newlement:) method in your linked list class


//Review Four: Write a reverse() method in your linked list class




//Problem One: Given a singly linked list as input, write a function that returns the nth to last element

//Example
//Input: a -> b -> c -> d-> e, 2
//Output: d

//Problem Two: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.

//EXAMPLE
//Input: the node ‘c’ from the linked list a->b->c->d->e
//Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e

//Problem Three: You have two numbers represented by a singly linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1’s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

//EXAMPLE
//Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)
//Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8


//Problem Four: Split a linked list in half
//Input: a -> b -> c -> d-> e
//Output: (a->b->c, d->e)
