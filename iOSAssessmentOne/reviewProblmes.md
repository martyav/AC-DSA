##Data Structures

Give an example situation that is best modeled using a:
- Queue
- Stack
- Array
- Linked List

##Big O
Write a function that takes:
-Linear Time
-Constant Time
-Quadratic Time
-Cubic Time
-Linearithmic Time

##Algorithm Solving

Given a square matrix of size n x n, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals

What is the runtime complexity of your algorithm?


Given an array of size n, return the last index for which the right and left neighbors of the element are equal.  If no such element exists, return nil.

Sample input: [3,1,3,2,9,4,1,4]

Sample output: 6

Sample Input: [4,2,6,2,7,2,5,3,9,3,1,2]

Sample output: 8


Sample input: [1,5,2,6,8,24,133]

Sample output: nil

What is the runtime complexity of your algorithm?


##Linked Lists

Implement a Linked List.  Give it insert(newElement:at:), delete(at:), isEmpty() and getElement(at:) methods.


##Stacks

Implement a Stack using an Array.

Implememnt a Stack using a Linked List.

##Queues

Implement a Queue using a Linked List.
